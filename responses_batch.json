{"1": {"query": "Hint: Please answer the question requiring a floating-point number with one decimal place and provide the final value, e.g., 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, at the end.\nQuestion: When a spring does work on an object, we cannot find the work by simply multiplying the spring force by the object's displacement. The reason is that there is no one value for the force-it changes. However, we can split the displacement up into an infinite number of tiny parts and then approximate the force in each as being constant. Integration sums the work done in all those parts. Here we use the generic result of the integration.\r\n\r\nIn Figure, a cumin canister of mass $m=0.40 \\mathrm{~kg}$ slides across a horizontal frictionless counter with speed $v=0.50 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}$. It then runs into and compresses a spring of spring constant $k=750 \\mathrm{~N} / \\mathrm{m}$. When the canister is momentarily stopped by the spring, by what distance $d$ is the spring compressed?", "response": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the work done by the spring on the canister when it is momentarily stopped. The work done by a spring force is given by the integral of the force over the displacement. In this case, the force is the spring force, which is equal to the spring constant times the displacement. The displacement is the distance the canister is compressed by the spring.\n\nThe spring constant is given as $k = 750 \\mathrm{~N/m}$. The mass of the canister is given as $m = 0.40 \\mathrm{~kg}$. The initial velocity of the canister is given as $v = 0.50 \\mathrm{~m/s}$. We can use the formula for work done by a spring force:\n\n\\[ W = \\int_{0}^{d} k x \\, dx \\]\n\nwhere $W$ is the work done, $k$ is the spring constant, $x$ is the displacement, and $dx$ is an infinitesimal displacement.\n\nFirst, we need to find the displacement $d$. Since the canister is momentarily stopped by the spring, its velocity is zero. Therefore, the displacement $d$ is equal to the initial velocity", "question_type": "free_form", "answer_type": "float", "choices": null, "precision": 1.0, "answer": "1.2"}, "2": {"query": "Hint: Please answer the question requiring an integer answer and provide the final value, e.g., 1, 2, 3, at the end.\nQuestion: what is the total volume of the measuring cup?
